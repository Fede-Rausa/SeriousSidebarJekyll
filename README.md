# jekyll-theme-serious-sidebar

A Jekyll theme with a sidebar easy to use in github pages.
The demo is live at [this theme guide](https://fede-rausa.github.io/SeriousSidebarJekyll/) 
To use it, I recommend:
- to watch the parameters that you can adjust in the _config.yml file showed in [this table](https://fede-rausa.github.io/SeriousSidebarJekyll/customization/additional.html)
- to see the example of _config.yml IN THE docs folder of this repo (the docs folder is the website of the demo).

It is an upgraded version of Zendesk Garden. I have copied their code and give the user some additional powers.
If You want to use their version it is at this repo: [repo of zendesk-garden-jekyll-theme]( https://github.com/zendesk/jekyll-theme-zendesk-garden)
While their demo is here: [demo of zendesk-garden-jekyll-theme](https://zendesk.github.io/jekyll-theme-zendesk-garden/)

## Usage

### GitHub Pages

Define a `_config.yml` file in your GitHub pages directory and specify this remote theme:

```yaml
remote_theme: Fede-Rausa/SeriousSidebarJekyll@main
```

Thanks to Zendesk, without whose code I would have wasted much more time to make this project.
