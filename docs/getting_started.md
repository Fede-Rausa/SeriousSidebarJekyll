## Initialize Config

Add a `_config.yml` file to your docs directory. That can either be the repository root, or `/docs`.
Specify this theme as the `remote_theme`.

```yaml
remote_theme: zendesk/jekyll-theme-zendesk-garden@v0.3.2
```

That's it! This will setup the minimal theme to be active once you enable GitHub pages in your
repo settings.

## Additional Features

[Sidebar Navigation](./customization/sidebar.md) and [Search](./customization/search.md) can be
enabled through additional site configuration.
